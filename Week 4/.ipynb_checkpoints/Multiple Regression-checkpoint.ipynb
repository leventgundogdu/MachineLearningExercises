    "### Multiple Regression\n",
    "   Multiple regression is like linear regression, but with more than one independent value, meaning that we try to predict a value based on two or more variables.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Take a look at the data set below, it contains some information about cars. There are 5 columns: Car, model, volume, weight and CO2. There are 36 different cars forming 36 rows.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   We can predict the CO2 emission of a car based on the size of the engine, but with multiple regression we can throw in more variables, like the weight of the car, to make the prediction more accurate.\n",
    "#### How Does it Work?\n",
    "   In Python we have modules that will do the work for us. Start by importing the Pandas module. Pandas is a Python library and is used to analyze data. The Pandas module allows us to read csv files and return a DataFrame object. \n",
    "   Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The name \"Pandas\" has a reference to both \"Panel Data\", and \"Python Data Analysis\" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant. Relevant data is very important in data science.\n",
    "   Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:\n",
    "   Is there a correlation between two or more columns?\n",
    "    What is average value?\n",
    "    Max value?\n",
    "    Min value?\n",
    "    Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sklearn (scikit-learn) module:  Includes simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. Accessible to everybody, reusable in various contexts, built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, open source, commercially usable. Things that you can do with sklearn are: Classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection and preprocessing.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The file containing the above mentioned information about the cars is meant for testing purposes only, we can download it from the web site of our text book."
